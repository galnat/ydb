### Bug fixes

* Fixed an rare issue that caused client applications to hang during commit operations. The problem occurred because the `TEvDeletePartition` message could arrive before the `TEvApproveWriteQuota` message. The batch did not send TEvConsumed and this blocked the queue of write quota requests. [#17122](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/17122) ([Alek5andr-Kotov](https://github.com/Alek5andr-Kotov))
